ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fred!

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working at Nationalencyclopedin.

Most of my repositories here are quite old, from my education at Medieinstituet in MalmÃ¶, Sweden. Some are collabs with classmates.

fredrik-p/fredrik-p is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
